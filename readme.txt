WPC Role-Based Payment Methods enables the restriction of available Payment Gateways for each user role.

**WPC Role-Based Payment Methods** enables the restriction of available Payment Gateways for each user role.

For example, an Admin will have access to all payment options, while a Guest will only see Cash on Delivery and PayPal as payment methods.

= Features =

- Manage user roles for all payment gateways on one screen
- Allow to select All, User (logged in), and Guest (non logged in)
- Allow to select all available user roles
